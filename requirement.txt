Dear statistics savvy people please read the instruction below.

Data Files
1. Original 500 sample file: original data
2. Old 500 Representation file: Difference between data points of original data

Requirement
- I am expecting to python implementations using sk-learn library.
- pXC50 is the dependent variable in file 1 and file 2
- You can remove (molecule_id) it is useless.

1. Use Random Forest Regression to predict pXC50 in original file 1 and the other file
2 : use 10-Fold cross-validation for training and testing (used fixed indexes. )

I want to do regression on this data to predict pXC50 value using Python (sklearn) library 
10 fold cross validation should be used (fix the indexes) I need to know the indexes of the training and testing tests
